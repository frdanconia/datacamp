Starts with, ends with
You've already seen how you can search for certain characters at the beginning of a string using the caret "^". Of course, regular expressions also offer a way to search for things at the end of a string. This is what the dollar sign "$" will do.

When creating a pattern to look for something at the beginning of a line, use the caret followed by a search term "^___". When looking for something at the end, type the search term first and then append the dollar sign "___$". The order of appearance is very important when creating regular expressions.

```{r}
# Familiarize yourself with the vector by printing it
movie_titles

# List all movies that start with "The"
movie_titles[str_detect(
  movie_titles,
  pattern = "^The"
)]

# List all movies that end with "3D"
movie_titles[str_detect(
  movie_titles,
  pattern = "3D$"
)]
```

If you don't know what you're looking for
So far you've used str_detect() which returns TRUE if the pattern matches and FALSE otherwise. But regular expressions are also excellent at extracting the searched term from a larger amount of text. You can use the str_match() function for that.

The next special character you'll get to know is the period: ".". The period matches any character, it's like a wild card. So if you search for example for "..." you will find three characters - be it letters or numbers or even white spaces.

This is pretty handy, except if you need to search for an actual full stop ".". In that case: escape the period with two backslashes: "\\."
```{r}

```
