ImportDocs(user.input)
}
\arguments{
\item{user.input}{= a list with elements directing the

}
\description{
This is the main document importing function. It is formatted
to work in the confines of an in-development Shiny app.
Those making an R script should *not*
use this function. Instead, use other functions, such as
Vec2Dtm() directly.

output: a list with two objects
      dtm = the document term matrix
      tf.mat = a dataframe of corpus-wide statistics
